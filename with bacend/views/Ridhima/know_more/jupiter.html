        Average temperature<br>
         Approximately -110°C at an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar (an arbitrarily defined ‘surface’ for Jupiter where surface pressure matches that of sea level on Earth – this is 125 degrees colder than Earth’s mean sea level temperature).
<br><br>
Atmosphere:<br>
 Jupiter has the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, composed of mostly hydrogen (approx. 90%) and helium (10%), with minor amounts of methane, ammonia, and other trace gases and aerosols.
<br><br>
Moons<br>
 92; the four largest are known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto). 12 of these 92 moons were discovered as recently as February 2023. Jupiter’s largest moon is Ganymede – a truly unique world that will be a key focus for ESA’s Juice mission.

Rings <br>
 While not as visible as those around its neighbour Saturn,

 Impressive features
<br> Jupiter experiences giant storms, powerful winds, aurorae, and extreme temperatures and pressures. The Great Red Spot is a high-pressure storm that has been raging for several centuries: its winds swirl rapidly, hitting speeds of up to 680 km per hour (over three times as fast as the most powerful hurricanes ever recorded on Earth). The spot is found in Jupiter’s southern hemisphere and appears to be shifting and shrinking, although it is still larger than Earth.
