     <p class="para"> How big is Mercury?
        <br>
        Mercury is slightly larger than our Moon - 15,329 kilometres around its equator. Its radius, the distance from
        the core's centre to the surface, is 2,440 kilometres. Mercury is about 2.6 times smaller than Earth.
        <br><br>
        How hot is Mercury?
        <br><br>
        Mercury's sun-facing side is scorched by temperatures of around 430°C, hot enough to melt lead.
        <br>
        Without a substantial atmosphere to distribute heat away from the areas facing the Sun, the planet's slow
        rotation makes for stark differences in temperature between its dark and light sides. The side facing away cools
        to an approximate -180°C.
        <br>
        But despite the intense heat the planet faces as it rotates, areas that are permanently shaded, such as some
        polar craters, may hold deposits of ice.
        <br>
        Intense changes in temperature from day to night make it impossible for life as we know it to flourish on
        Mercury.
        <br><br>
        How far from the Sun is Mercury?
        <br><br>
        Mercury's orbit is elongated, taking an almost oval- or egg-shaped course around the Sun. This means that its
        distance from the Sun varies throughout its circuit, between approximately 46 million and 70 million kilometres.

        Mercury speeds around the Sun at nearly 47 kilometres per second - almost 60% faster than Earth's orbiting
        speed.
        <br><br>

        How long is a day on Mercury?
        <br>
        Days on Mercury are very long because the planet rotates very slowly. One day-long spin lasts for 59 Earth days.
        But because of its fast orbit, one Mercury year takes 88 Earth days. This means that two years on Mercury lasts
        for only three days.

        The planet's sunrise would be unusual to us on Earth. Due to its elongated orbit and slow rotation, from some
        places on Mercury's surface, the Sun appears to rise briefly before setting and rising again. At sunset, the
        reverse happens, with the Sun appearing to set twice.

        The planet spins almost vertically on its axis, so its poles are never fully sunlit. The lack of tilt also means
        that the planet does not experience yearly seasons like Earth.
